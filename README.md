# Econometrics (Advanced Level) - 2024/2025

This repository contains resources and materials for the **Econometrics (Advanced Level)** course for the 2024/2025 academic year, part of the **Data Analytics for Business and Economics Full Time Magister 2** program at the **Higher School of Economics - Saint Petersburg**.

## Course Overview
This advanced-level econometrics course covers topics essential for understanding and applying econometric models in economics and data analytics. Topics span from univariate and multivariate dynamic models to advanced time series analysis, volatility modeling, and non-stationary time series methods.

## Modules and Topics

### General
This section contains general information about the course, guidelines, and introductory resources.

   - **Lecture 7: Models with a Time Trend and Cointegration** _(Currently not available)_

### Research Task
A final research task will be required, encouraging students to apply the methods and models learned throughout the course to a real-world dataset or theoretical econometric problem.

## Requirements
- A foundational understanding of econometrics, linear algebra, and statistics.
- Familiarity with statistical software such as R or Python is recommended for practical application.

## Course Structure
- **Lectures** will cover theoretical foundations and mathematical derivations.
- **Practical sessions** (if available) will include applied exercises and hands-on projects to reinforce concepts.
  
## Notes
Some materials are currently marked as "Not available" and will be uploaded as the course progresses.
